"""
Configuration for Multi-Task Federated Learning experiment.

MambaMixer (SSD-Net) with cross-task backbone aggregation.
  - 50 ASHRAE buildings: 35 forecasting train clients + 15 test
  - 50 LEAD buildings:   35 anomaly train clients + 15 test
  - Backbone aggregated across ALL 70 clients (cross-task)
  - Task heads aggregated within each task group (35 each)
